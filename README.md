Eight bands and resonance.

## Ideas

- [ ] The routing is kind of funny. Think about that
- [ ] Could have some modes
- [ ] crow interface
- [ ] grid interface
- [ ] arc interface?
- [ ] Default OP-Z interface with notes as shifts
- [ ] A more straightforwards control scheme, maybe with button combos since 2^3 = 8
- [ ] More bands?
- [x] Resonance control with rq
- [ ] Another concept?
- [ ] More info about banking crises?
- [x] Demo video or at least sounds?
- [ ] Retune?
